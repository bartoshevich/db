**A personal site and thought leadership platform by Dmitry Bartoshevich â€” marketing strategist and brand consultant.**

The site is built and maintained as a personal project. It is fast, privacy-focused, and fully controlled â€” built without trackers, distractions, or cookie banners. I'm not a professional developer â€” web development is a hobby for me, a way to shape my ideas and communicate with clarity, speed, and purpose.

## Highlights

- Built entirely with [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- Analytics via [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com), no cookies or personal data
- Stack: Nunjucks, Sass, esbuild, PostCSS

## Live site
